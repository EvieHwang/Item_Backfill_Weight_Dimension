Agentic Backfill of Weight & Dimension Item Data
This project creates an agentic AI system using Claude to predict missing weight and dimension data for products in supply chain operations. The system connects to Google Sheets, processes item information, and returns enhanced data with weight and dimension predictions.

Project Overview
The Agentic Backfill system helps solve a common supply chain problem: missing or inaccurate product dimensions and weights. By leveraging AI, we can predict these values based on product descriptions and categories, improving shipping cost estimates, storage optimization, and overall logistics efficiency.

Features
Automated prediction of product weights and dimensions
Google Sheets integration for easy data input/output
RAG implementation for contextual data enhancement
Confidence scoring system for predictions
Optimization parameters for different product categories
