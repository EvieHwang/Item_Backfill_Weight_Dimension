Reasoning:
- Longboard is a typical size of 41 inches long
- Bamboo and fiberglass construction suggests moderate weight
- Comparable longboards from brands like Sector 9 and Landyachtz typically weigh between 2.5-3.5 kg
- Specific material composition (bamboo core, fiberglass, HD plastic) indicates lightweight but sturdy design
- Recommended rider weight range (120-170 lbs) suggests a board around 2.8-3.2 kg
- Converted to grams: 2,850 grams (2.85 kg)

Confidence is high due to multiple contextual clues about materials, similar product comparisons, and specific product design details. The prediction falls within the expected weight range for a high-quality longboard of this size and construction."

I'll explain my reasoning:

This is a model airplane building kit with multiple components, which suggests a moderate weight. Based on the detailed description mentioning:
- Multiple plane designs (8 different planes)
- Over 35 parts
- Components include:
  - Balsa wood wings
  - Tails & bodies
  - Plastic propellers
  - Landing gear
  - Rubber motors
  - Carrying case/box

Comparable model airplane kits typically range between 300-400 grams. The inclusion of balsa wood parts, multiple components, and a carrying case points to a weight around 345 grams.

My confidence in this estimate is approximately 85%, based on:
- Detailed product description
- Known weight ranges for similar model airplane kits
- Comprehensive list of included components

The prediction of 345 grams accounts for the wood parts, plastic components, and packaging, representing a typical weight for a comprehensive airplane model building kit."
